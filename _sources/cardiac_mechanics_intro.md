# Cardiac Mechanics

In this section we will cover the necessary theory of continuum
mechanics in order to model the mechanics of the heart. The theory of
continuum mechanics is extensive, and we will not be able to cover
everything. For a complete review of continuum mechanics the reader is
therefore referred the textbook of Gerhard Holzapfel
{cite}`holzapfel2000nonlinear` from which most of the theory in this
section is taken. For the even more mathematically oriented reader we
refer to {cite}`marsden1994mathematical`.
